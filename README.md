🌦️ Weather Insights Dashboard – Power BI

A modern and visually engaging Weather Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. This dashboard provides real-time weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, air-quality insights, humidity & wind analysis, sunrise/sunset times, and precipitation probabilities—all in a clean, interactive interface.

📌 1. Project Overview

The Weather Insights Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to help users understand current and upcoming weather conditions in various cities.
It visually represents temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality, UV index, precipitation, visibility, and multi-day forecasts in an intuitive layout.

This dashboard is ideal for:

Weather enthusiasts

Students learning data visualization

Analysts studying environmental patterns

Travelers planning trips

Anyone who wants a refined weather report experience

🎯 2. Purpose of the Dashboard

The primary goal of this dashboard is to:

Provide a clear snapshot of current weather conditions

Display 7-day forecast trends (temperature & climate)

Highlight air quality parameters like PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5 & Ozone

Help users quickly assess environmental conditions

Deliver an interactive, polished UI that reflects real-world weather applications

🛠️ 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools:

Power BI Desktop – for report creation

Power Query – data cleaning & transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – calculated measures, KPIs

Data Modeling – structured relationships for clean performance

File Formats – .pbix for the dashboard, .png for preview images
