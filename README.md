🌦️ Weather Insights Dashboard – Power BI
The Weather Insights Dashboard is a Power BI report designed to present real-time and forecasted weather information through clean, interactive, and visually engaging charts. It provides a consolidated view of temperature, humidity, air quality, and seven-day forecast trends for multiple cities, helping users quickly understand environmental conditions at a glance.


📌 1. Project Overview
This dashboard was created to simplify how users interact with weather information. Instead of searching through scattered reports or applications, this Power BI dashboard brings all essential weather metrics into one unified interface. The design focuses on clarity, usability, and smooth navigation between cities.

🎯 2. Objective
The primary objective of this dashboard is to offer:

A clear snapshot of current weather conditions

A 7-day forecast trend for temperature changes

A detailed breakdown of air quality components

Quick access to environmental parameters like humidity, wind speed, pressure, UV index, and visibility

A visually appealing, minimalistic interface for smooth user experience


🛠️ 3. Tools & Technologies

This project was developed using the following components:

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development and visualization

Power Query Editor – Data shaping, cleaning, and formatting

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculations for KPIs and dynamic metrics

Data Modeling – Relationship management within the dataset

Image Assets (.png) – Used for icons and visual enhancement

.pbix File – Final dashboard file


🌍 4. Data Information

The dashboard is designed using weather data that includes:

Current temperature and climate conditions

Seven-day weather forecast

Air quality indicators (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, Ozone)

Humidity, visibility, precipitation, UV index

Sunrise and sunset timings

Note: The structure can support static datasets or API-based weather data depending on the user’s requirement.
